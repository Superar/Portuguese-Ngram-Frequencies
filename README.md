# N-gram Frequency Counts for the Portuguese Language

This repository contains the code used to generate the n-gram frequency counts for the Portuguese language. The n-gram frequency counts were generated using [BrWaC](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/pln/wiki/index.php?title=BrWaC) corpus. Our project is based on the work of [orgtre/google-books-ngram-frequency](https://github.com/orgtre/google-books-ngram-frequency).

This repository contains the following files:

```
Portuguese-Ngram-Frequencies
├─── results [Folder with the n-gram frequency counts]
└─── scripts [Folder with the scripts used to generate the n-gram frequency counts]
```

## How to install

You can install the required dependencies using [python uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv). To do so, run the following command:

```bash
uv venv
uv sync
```

If you want to install the dependencies using pip, you can run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run

To generate the n-gram frequency counts, you first need to have the BrWaC in a folder named `data` in the root of the project. The BrWaC corpus can be downloaded from [here](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/pln/wiki/index.php?title=BrWaC).

Then, first run the `script/preprocess_brwac.sh` script to preprocess the BrWaC corpus. This script will generate a one-sentence-per-line version of the BrWaC corpus in the `data` folder, named `brwac_awk.txt`.

After that, run the `script/run_ngrams.sh` script to generate the n-gram frequency counts. This script will generate the n-gram frequency counts in the `results` folder.
